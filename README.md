# My Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my Neovim configuration! Since I'm constantly updating my setup and
switching between computers, I decided to upload my config to GitHub. If you've
somehow stumbled on my repository, feel free to browse around and try it out.

A huge thanks to [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen). Before I made
my own config, I used his to get my feet wet with Neovim. My experiences
with his setup heavily inspired this config.
